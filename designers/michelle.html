                    <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
                    <p>Born and raised in Mexico, Michelle Jaramillo brings a unique cultural lens to her work. As an
                        immigrant, adapting to a new environment has shaped the way she sees and interacts with the
                        world—something that comes through in her art. From an early age, she was drawn to creative
                        expression in all its forms—painting, glass fusing, photography, graphic design, and beyond. But
                        throughout her journey, one passion has always remained at the center for her, fashion.
                        <br>
                        Michelle’s designs are inspired by the world around her, surroundings, the richness of color, raw
                        emotion, and the feel of texture. All play a role in shaping her creative vision. She sees fashion
                        not only as a form of art but as a powerful medium to tell stories, evoke feelings, and make
                        whoever wears her pieces feel special.
                        <br>
                        Now on the path to graduation, Michelle is focused on building her clothing brand, where she
                        merges her love for design with her personal experiences and artistic background. Through each
                        piece, she aims to bring life to her inspirations and share a part of her world with others.</p>

                    <h2>Collection Overview</h2>
                    <p>During the process of creating this collection Poetic, I was inspired by the Romanticism era and
                        wanted to blend that feeling with the reality of modern life. My goal was to design looks that can
                        be worn all day—easy, comfortable pieces that still feel romantic and elegant.
                        <br>
                        I designed pieces that have a couture feel, but with touches of streetwear that make them
                        versatile. The silhouettes are based on classic styles, but each one has its own unique twist, from
                        appliqués to embroidered fabrics. I wanted the clothes to feel light, organic, and full of emotion.</p>
