                    <p class="description">Representing the Clown, model Emily Keller wears a white two-piece linen set with black piping and matching armbands. The peplum from the bodice transitions into the two gathered layers of the skirt, creating the illusion that the two pieces are a seamless whole.</p>

                    <p class="description">The bodice is flat-lined with canvas, providing structure and allowing the front of the bodice to stand on its own away from the body, adding a theatrical flair to the neckline. The billowing gathers and contrasting piping are directly inspired by similar details found in vintage clown costumes.</p>

                    <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
                    <p>Born and raised in Minnesota, Audrey Rankin grew up wrapped in quilts and clothing made by her grandmother who was an avid sewer. Early on, she learned to view sewing and creating as an act of love and a brief stint in theater left her with an admiration for costuming. When considering future career paths, Audrey was drawn to the endless creative possibilities of costume design. Her time at Minneapolis College has left her with a deep appreciation for technical skills and methods and the freedom to be able to create whatever she wants. Audrey looks forward to continuing to learn and develop her skills after graduating.</p>

                    <h2>Designer Statement</h2>
                    <p>My collection, “Cards,” is a series of looks representing members of a carnival. From the clown to the acrobat, the fortune teller to the magician; my looks are inspired by the extravagance of vintage costumes. My main influences were fashion illustrations from the 1930s and 40s and art nouveau paintings of masquerade balls. The colors are moody and worn, meant to show that these costumes were once bright and vibrant, but have been dulled by years of use.</p>
