                    <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
                    <p>Chia was born in Laos and came to St. Paul, MN when she was 7 years old. Chia has always been into fairy tales and princesses ever since she was young. She would often draw princesses in beautiful gowns and dresses. Through this love, she wanted to be able to create dresses to help girls feel like a princess themselves. She loves just being able to embrace being a girl and being able to feel good in whatever she wears. This led to Chia exploring fashion as a possible career choice. Exploring fashion as a college degree led her to North Central University where she is attending as a student (currently a junior). Through North Central University's applied studies program with MCTC, Chia is able to get her fashion degree through both schools. Chia is excited about growing in her knowledge of fashion so that she can continue to bring her designs to life. One day, she hopes to open up her own line and store.

                    <h2>Collection Overview</h2>
                    <p>TSpring Fever is a collection that brings magical and dreamy to life. The
                        inspiration behind Spring Fever came from the desire to bring fairy tales into life
                        and incorporating it into the real world. With that said, Spring Fever embraces the
                        magicalness of Spring. The collection highlights parts of the spring season that
                        makes it so magical- the flowers, the blue sky, the greeneries, and also the
                        beautiful night sky with a thousand stars that only seems to come out in the
                        Spring and Summer seasons.
                        
                        The collectionâ€™s colors are mainly bright pastel colors except for one design
                        that highlights the night sky. Otherwise the colors are bright and very colorful.
                        The fabric and materials chosen are soft and light materials- tulle, organza,
                        batiste, and chion. Through the combination of the soft colors and soft
                        materials, Spring Fever is able to incorporate the feeling of softness and light,
                        bringing on a magical feel.
                        
                        Spring Fever is really for anybody who appreciates the beauty of wanting
                        to feel magical and free. When wearing the garment, the wearer should feel like
                        they are their own Cinderella. A magical moment where they feel like a princess
                        themselves, even in the real world.
