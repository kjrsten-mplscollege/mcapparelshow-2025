                    <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
                    <p>Growing up in a 100-year-old farmhouse in the early 90s, Callyn learned early on how important her environment would be to her identity and sense of aesthetics. An emphasis on being outside and learning to find enjoyment without mobile technology is a cornerstone of living well that she holds dearly as an adult. She finds beauty in simplicity, nature, and the finer things in life, which have been priorities that have led her to pursue her education in handmade clothing construction. Prior to Minneapolis College’s Apparel Technologies program, Callyn obtained a bachelor's degree in communications and worked in marketing. As a self-taught sewer, her desire to learn more and sharpen her skills began to grow, along with her disdain for sitting at a desk. Callyn is so grateful to the Apparel Technologies program, the instructors, and her fellow classmates for making the experience so wonderful. After graduation, Callyn plans to continue to make handmade garments in the slow fashion space.</p>

                    <h2>Designer Statement</h2>
                    <p>My collection, “Garden Court,” combines minimalism and natural luxury. I’m inspired by the idea of melding the tastefulness of country club tennis matches with the effortless beauty of nature—hence the name “Garden Court.” The pieces I made reflect this through primarily natural fibers like linen, wool, and cotton. I intentionally incorporated understated and minimal design details to emphasize the natural beauty of the human form. I draw inspiration from the simplicity of textures and colors seen in nature. The aim of “Garden Court” is to elevate these reflections into wearable and timeless garments. </p>
