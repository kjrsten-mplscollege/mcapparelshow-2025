                    <p class="description">Model Charlie Becker is wearing a 100% linen fit. This being the first look of the collection it represents the origin of fashion using the oldest textile. The silhouette is both elegant and comfortable with its own specific features. The top is a sleeveless T-shirt with elongated shoulders to add flare. The bottoms are inspired by a classic pant with unique style lines.</p>

                    <p class="description">The pants are constructed similarly to a traditional work-pant with a double knee for durability. Instead of the classic straight lines, these pants have curved style lines throughout the design. This curved wave pattern is repeated with the double knee, the pockets, and the overlapping front closure.</p>

                    <p class="description">There is no hardware, such as zippers or buttons, anywhere within this design. The pants are fastened by a strap within the waistband that extends out and wraps around towards the back The strap goes through two belt loops and is brought back through the first to secure the fit.

                    <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
                    <p>Jack was born and raised in Minnesota and spent most of his time outside away from screens, exploring nature. Jack has always had a drive to make the world a better place and strives to leave each day better than he found it. Jack has worked for years in the fashion and music industry with a diverse list of creatives and artists as a ‘jack of all trades.’ He regularly travels to LA and NYC to be a creative support and crucial input when it comes to music, fashion, styling, set design, and anything that is asked of him.

                    <h2>Designer Statement</h2>
                    <p>My collection, “Verdant Burn,” shows the evolution of our world and humanity's impact on it through the unique medium of fashion. I started this journey with a simplistic silhouette made of linen, one of the oldest textiles created. “Verdant Burn” evolves alongside the story of our place on the planet, drawing inspiration from both historical and current styles. My intention is to call out fast fashion on the seemingly irreversible gross overproduction and consumption of clothing. Through the use of recycled plastics, “Verdant Burn” explores the potential future of textiles in fashion. I want to strike fear into those who couldn’t care less while sparking creativity in future generations to grow together and heal the world.</p>
