                    <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
                    <p>Raised in Boston and Maine, Emily spent nearly two decades in San Francisco, California, working as an obstetric nurse. She moved with her young family to Minnesota in 2021. It was here that she decided to pursue her true passion: fashion and sewing. Her inspiration comes from the years spent in Northern California amongst the giant redwoods, the rugged pacific coast and the eclectic city she left her heart in. Emily is especially interested in the areas of pattern making, tailoring/alterations, thrifting fabric, fashion upcycling and making people cozy. </p>

                    <h2>Collection Overview</h2>
                    <p>I am thrilled to introduce my debut collection, “Archer,” under my brand Shoot the Moon. My brand inspires everyone to aim high for their dreams—reaching as far as the moon! 

                        Archer embodies the spirit of a free-spirited nature lover. The woman who wears these clothes prioritizes comfort while standing out. This collection draws heavily from the nature and landscapes of San Francisco and Northern California. The looks are monochromatic in shades of green and orange, reminiscent of the redwood forests and vibrant poppy flowers. From the mossy forest floor to the foggy redwood canopy, and from the rugged coastline to the layered hills of the city by the bay, I aim to replicate these elements in my designs. 
                        
                        I gravitate towards familiar yet sumptuous and cozy fabrics with rich textures. For this collection, I worked with fleece, stretch velour, wool knit, windbreaker fabric, and even an upcycled bed quilt. My goal was to create clothing that is both comfortable and elevated, with pieces that can be mixed and matched. At the heart of Archer are silhouettes that are comfortable on the body and easy to wear.</p>
