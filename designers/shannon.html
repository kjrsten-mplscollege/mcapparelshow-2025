              Model Kate Brantseg wears a light-hearted take on a flannel shirt
              and fishing waders. The shirt is made of silk chiffon in a black
              and orange buffalo check, and the pants feature a woodsy hunting
              camouflage print.

              The design elements in the pants are reminiscent of historical
              breeches, with a high waist and cuffs that hit just below the
              knee. They feature a sailor pant closure, with a double-row of
              buttons in the front. Black rain boots and suspenders round out
              the “fishing waders” effect.

              The “flannel shirt” look is elevated with voluminous bishop
              sleeves that show off the sheer, airy quality of the silk chiffon.

            <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
            <p>
              Shannon was born and raised on the North Shore of Minnesota. She
              has always been drawn to creative outlets, having previously
              earned a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in music performance on
              the French horn. While she’s had a long-standing interest in
              costuming, it was only recently that she decided to take the
              plunge into making it a career, landing a job in a costume shop
              and enrolling in the Apparel Technologies program at Minneapolis
              College to develop her skills. Her work has appeared in hundreds
              of shows at Chanhassen Dinner Theatres, as well as at local
              cosplay conventions, and she hopes to bring a high level of
              technical skill to future productions.

            <h2>Collection Overview</h2>
            <p>
              My collection, “H(a)unted”, is a bold display of my love of all
              things costuming. It combines techniques and silhouettes found in
              historical garment making, theatre, and cosplay to add a playful
              touch to the story of The Hunter versus The Deer. The colors and
              patterns are reminiscent of clothing I associate strongly with my
              childhood, and I strove to create imaginative, yet high-end
              garments using unexpected materials - a “flannel” shirt made in
              silk chiffon, or an extravagant gown made of camo utility fabric.
              “H(a)unted” is quite a self-indulgent collection, but I hope it
              inspires others to seek the whimsy in their own lives.
