                    <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
                    <p>Megan Sandberg is a fashion designer whose work explores the intersection of natural
                        beauty and personal empowerment. Born and raised in the small northern Minnesota town
                        of Cotton, Megan was inspired by her mother’s creative talent and intuitive design sense.
                        Her mother could craft garments without patterns, incorporating thoughtful details to
                        complement individual body shapes—a skill and mindset that left a lasting impression.
                        Megan’s clothing brand, Megalily Apparel, embraces a vibrant aesthetic that exudes an
                        aura of elegance. Her mission is to design clothing that makes women of all sizes feel
                        beautiful, confident, and comfortable. Her work reflects not just a love for fashion, but a
                        deep understanding of how clothing can empower and uplift. Moving forward, she hopes to
                        expand Megalily Apparel through inclusive collaborations and collections that continue to
                        celebrate and support women from all walks of life.</p>

                    <h2>Collection Overview</h2>
                    <p>Megan Sandberg's "Radiance" collection is a celebration of natural beauty and personal
                        empowerment. This vibrant line of garments masterfully combines classic silhouettes with modern
                        sophistication, creating pieces that are both timeless and contemporary.
                        <br>
                        The collection features dresses that move gracefully with the body, intricate detailing that adds a
                        touch of elegance, and a rich palette of colors. One of the standout aspects of the "Radiance"
                        collection is its commitment to inclusivity. Each piece has been designed to flatter and celebrate the
                        women wearing them. The inclusive sizing ensures that every woman can find something that not
                        only fits well but also makes her feel confident and beautiful.
                        <br>
                        Whether you're dressing up for a special occasion or looking for something chic and comfortable for
                        everyday wear, the "Radiance" collection has something to offer.
                        <br>
                        In essence, the "Radiance" collection is more than just fashion, it's a celebration of individuality and a
                        testament to the power of feeling good in what you wear.</p>
