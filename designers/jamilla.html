                    <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
                    <p>Jamilla was born and raised in North Minneapolis. Her African American Muslim background is integral to her designs, influencing her choices in cut, fit, and color. Early in her life, she was fascinated with styling and accessorizing, which eventually led her to becoming her family’s go-to stylist. But soon, styling wasn't enough to satisfy her creative spirit, so she sought out Minneapolis College’s Apparel Design program to master the art of clothing alteration and construction. Her focus is to create memorable looks for members of the film and music industry, but she also hopes to explore the many possibilities the fashion world has to offer.</p>

                    <h2>Designer Statement</h2>
                    <p>My collection “Fervent Memories,” is inspired by the clothing I dreamed of owning as I was growing up. I have always lived with a clear vision of my style, but as a hijabi I often struggled to find the perfect garments to fit my stylistic needs. Each look represents a phase of my life up to the present day, using layered interchangeable garments that speak with their own voice, but collectively say, “I am here with no fear.” I made this the focus of my collection to bring closure to this period of my life and move forward to the next dream. This collection is a visual embodiment of my journey towards mastering comfortability, movement, modesty, and swag.  With this collection, I hope to create a middle ground in current women’s fashion, walking the line between modest and revealing clothing and filling the empty space between these two extremes.</p>
