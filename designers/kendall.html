                    <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
                    <p>Kendall was born and raised in Minnesota. Growing up she paid great attention to the costumes in her favorite movies and shows, and took every opportunity to dress up, including wearing high heels to middle school. Working behind the scenes in theater during middle school created a deep love for costumes and fantasy. Her fondness for fairytales prompted a habit of creating new characters through her clothing choices, exploring a range of aesthetics. As she grew as an artist, she realized how much she wanted to learn more about fashion, leading her to apply to the Minneapolis College Apparel Technology program. She is currently in her senior year, creating her first magical runway collection.</p>

                    <h2>Designer Statement</h2>
                    <p>My collection, “Dungeons and Divas,” draws inspiration from the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons, a game involving fantastical adventures. With many different races and classes to choose from, the possibilities for character creation are endless. This game has motivated me to design outfits that combine both drama and fantasy. “Dungeons and Divas” showcases ensembles that transport the wearer to a magical world, enabling them to become the dream character they always wanted to be. Each outfit is unique and fun, crafted using various fabrics and textures. My goal is to create a range of confident and sexy short skirts and diverse tops. I hope “Dungeons and Divas” will inspire people to explore their creativity through fashion.</p>
