            <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
            <p>
              Adopted from China and raised in Minnesota Savannah Lowry-Luther
              always knew she wanted to peruse a career in art. Her interest in
              apparel design started when she watched a YouTube video by Micarah
              Tewer titled “How To Make Your Own Prom Dress!” It was then she
              decided to use that new found knowledge to create her sophomore
              homecoming dress, from there she found a love for dresses,
              fashion, and designing. She decided to continue her higher
              education by doing her freshman year at Meredith College where she
              majored in Fashion Design before transferring to Minneapolis
              college to finish her associates degree. Savannah hopes to start
              her own business one day and work one on one with clientele to
              create unique and personalized special occasion gowns and dresses
              that are meant to be classic and timeless.

            <h2>Collection Overview</h2>
            <p>
              My collection, “Keep it Classy” is my rendition of classic cuts
              with a modern twist. This collection contains only gowns and
              dresses of semi formal to formal wear. The classic element comes
              from the silhouettes that include a-line, ballgown, and mermaid
              skirts that have an assortment of different bodices like bustiers,
              corsets, halters, and strapless pieces. Some of the modern
              elements of my designs include skirt slits, open backs, and basque
              waist lines. My use of pearl beading and satin fabrics are used in
              each look because I’ve always associated them with elegance and
              sophistication, combining them to my designs adds a timeless
              appeal and natural beauty that I hope will make any wearer feel
              both confident and beautiful.
