                    <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
                    <p>Brian Abisai (Ah-bee-sah-ee) Diaz-Jimenez grew up in Bloomington, Minnesota. Abisai was raised by two Mexican immigrant parents, who did not get to attend or complete any schooling, making him a first-generation Chicano student. As a first-generation student he had no one to look to for guidance through his academic career; he was left to pursue his education himself. During his high school career, Abisai did not know what to do after graduation, but he was always drawn to the arts of the world, so he chose the path of working in fashion design. </p>

                    <h2>Designer Statement</h2>
                    <p>My debut collection, “Cherubii,” is inspired by cherub angels. To me, cherub angels are associated with youth, innocence, and playful, fun energy. I have always imagined clothing as having a whimsical nature; the ability to express yourself and truly feel comfortable not only in your own skin, but in your clothes as well. I draw inspiration from streetwear, skating apparel, oversized silhouettes, and K-pop. I liked the idea of mixing soft textiles like sherpa and fleece and rougher textiles like denim together to create comfortable designs for everyday wear. “Cherubii” is about being your authentic self without having to worry about conforming to others’ standards. To me “Cherubii” is an escape, the beginning of my journey of self-expression, and a way for me to express my creativity.</p>
