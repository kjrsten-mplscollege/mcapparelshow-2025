            <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
            <p>
                Born and raised in Beijing, China, known for her bold, avant-garde aesthetic blends gothic romanticism, punk, rebellion, and luxury. Initially pursuing in Environmental Science Policy and Management, then pivoted to apparel design in 2022. Xiaowen has had a great interest since she was in high school, influenced by fashion magazines and runway shows, self-taught and explored designing in her early years. Inspired by the surrealist audacity of Schiaparelli, the provocative tailoring of Jean Paul Gaultier, and Vivienne Westwood’s punk ethos, her collections exude a darkly glamorous sensibility. Xiaowen’s works are characterized by a clean line with textured detailing and sculpture of feminine curves, each piece has a great balance of rebellion and refinement. Her designs often explore contrasts: tradition and subversion, crafting narratives that challenge conventional beauty while celebrating individuality.

            <h2>Collection Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In this collection, the corset is redefined—not as a symbol of restriction, but as a structure of power and elegance. It moves fluidly through different settings—from casual daily wear to office wear and formal evening looks—reflecting the many roles and moods of the modern woman. It’s created for all people around all ages who love to dress beautifully and boldly, especially those drawn to the timeless confidence of black. </p>


                <p>The palette is built around deep blacks and charcoal, with occasional touches of silver and gold to add a hint of light. We used a mix of wool, satin, crepe, and cotton blends—balancing weight and softness, structure and flow, so the clothes feel elegant yet comfortable to wear. </p>
                
                
                <p>Most of the looks are modular and separable, allowing for mix-and-match styling across the collection. Each piece is designed to be visually coherent yet independently versatile, giving wearers the freedom to restyle their outfits based on the occasion, emotion, or even the weather. These garments are not meant to dictate how you dress—they are here to offer you more ways to express yourself. </p>
                
                
                <p>A highlight of the collection is the reversible corset, featuring two distinct textures and tones in one piece. It allows the wearer to shift between identities and aesthetics with ease—whether for a different mood or a new setting. </p>
                
                
                <p>The silhouettes are strong and clean, while rebellious details—like unexpected cuts, metallic accents, or bone-inspired seams—are subtly woven in, adding edge and personality to each look. </p>
                
                
                <p>This collection is about making a statement without shouting. Even in black, you can still shine. Even in quietness, you can still have an edge. These pieces reward attention. The more you look, the more you’ll see—just like getting to know someone beneath the surface.</p>
