                    <p class="description">Made with 100% leather hides, model Scarlet Shin rocks the combined colors of brown and dark gray to create an asymmetrical sleeved leather vest attached with a zipper running down the middle. The belt that surrounds the distressed waistline of the pleated skirt duplicates the dark leather of the bottom section of the vest, tying the garments together to evoke a passionately edgy sensation.</p>

                    <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
                    <p>Iris Guider was born and raised in St. Paul, Minnesota. Since she was young, she always had a soft spot for all kinds of art including painting, sketching and collaging, as well as listening to music—anything that allowed her to have a creative outlet. In the fall of 2023, Iris began studying Apparel Design at Minneapolis College to continue blossoming her growing interest in fashion. Since then, she has developed a unique vision and style for her clothing line. This spring, inspired by her fascination with music, Iris explores the art of expressing her passion through her equally intense infatuation for fashion. Through her line, Iris aims to construct clothing that evokes the same feeling that she pours into it—a true sense of personality. Moving forward, Iris will continue to expand her sewing and creative abilities to allow her to showcase her genuine adoration towards art.</p>

                    <h2>Collection Overview</h2>
                    <p>Rock ‘n’ Roll meets the daring possibilities of personal expression. “Harmony Rock”
                        embodies the gift of individuality and allows it to shine through everyday outfits. The inspiration
                        that drives my collection is music, in which I perceive to be one of the most therapeutic,
                        empowering and creative outlets in the world. It lifts my mood, relieves my anxiety, and it makes
                        me feel euphoric and nostalgic. In my line I aim to symbolize the most vital element of who I am
                        through my favorite form of art expression. I have developed a rock ‘n’ roll concept throughout
                        my line that characterizes my specific music taste. Some of my favorite bands are Mazzy Star,
                        Sublime, Alice in Chains, Third Eye Blind and The Smashing Pumpkins.</p>
