                    <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
                    <p>Abigail Gilbertson is a lingerie designer on a mission to change how women see themselves in
                        the mirror. Raised in the Midwest and studied at MCTC, she designs for the woman who refuses to
                        shrink, offering undergarments that fit, flatter, and empower. Her pieces are rooted in inclusivity and
                        self-celebration, with sizing and styling that challenge outdated beauty norms. Her line is designed for
                        women of all shapes and backgrounds, with the goal of replacing shame with celebration. Fueled by her own journey of self-acceptance and a passion for inclusive design, Abigail is redefining the standards of beauty one bralette at a time. Whether it’s lace, mesh, or minimalist silhouettes, her designs are made for real bodies and real confidence. As she continues her education at the University of Minnesota, Abigail is focused on building a brand that uplifts, rather than idealizes. Her work is a love letter to women everywhere soft, strong, and entirely unapologetic.</p>

                    <h2>Collection Overview</h2>
                    <p>The collection is composed of five distinct yet cohesive looks, each exuding a sultry, romantic
                        feel. This balance of romance and edge creates a unique aesthetic that feels timeless yet modern.
                        Featuring dresses, bras, corsets, undies, bloomers, mini skirts, stockings, and garters, the collection offers something for every lingerie lover. The silhouettes are designed to accentuate natural beauty while offering just the right amount of coverage, making the pieces as practical as they are alluring.
                        The soul of this collection lies in its seamless blend of comfort and sensuality. Designed with the
                        modern woman in mind, the pieces celebrate individuality, confidence, and self-love. At its core, the
                        collection conveys a powerful message that true beauty comes from being comfortable in your own skin.
                        
                        From conception to creation, the design process revolved around a single idea that lingerie should not
                        only look stunning but also feel incredible to wear. By focusing on comfort alongside aesthetics, the
                        collection stands out as a celebration of self-expression and self-acceptance, encouraging wearers to
                        embrace their own beauty and individuality.</p>
