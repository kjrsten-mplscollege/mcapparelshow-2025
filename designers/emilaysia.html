To create contrast, it’s paired with baggy, straight-leg jeans in neutral tones with hints of blue. Printed on the jeans are images of various industrial sites. Completing the look is a dark burgundy, glossy, crocodile-printed leather backpack slung over his shoulder.</p>

                    <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
                    <p>Born and raised in Minnesota Emilaysia’s love for fashion blossomed at the age of five, when she discovered project runway. She would then fall in love with the process of styling, Emilaysia would frequently style her mother and put together different outfits she didn't see often. Her love for styling would go on to be the foundation of her approach to designing. When creating Emilaysia imagines the many ways one piece can be styled, her focus is always the full look and not just the piece at hand. Because of this she bases each design on versatility and detail. Upon graduation Emilaysia plans to create an online store that offers capsule collections that make a statement and bring on a new point of view.</p>

                    <h2>Collection Overview</h2>
                    <p>My collection, ‘The Code’, is inspired by my identity as a designer and is heavily
                        influenced by my culture. Growing up, I didn’t see many designers highlighting the kind
                        of clothing that reflected my world and its versatility, and I’ve always wanted to change
                        that. With this collection, I’m celebrating the creativity and style that shaped me.
                        
                        I decided to name my line ‘The Code’ because Barcodes appear throughout the
                        collection as a symbol of identity. Traditionally used to label products, here they
                        represent that this collection is a direct product of who I am.
                        
                        Many of the pieces are things I wish I had in my closet, or styles I wish I saw more of. I
                        love taking everyday staples like T-shirts, jackets, and jeans and making them feel new
                        and exciting through screen printing and layering with different shapes and silhouettes.
                        With The Code, I hope to bring a new perspective and inspire others to tell their own
                        stories through fashion.</p>
